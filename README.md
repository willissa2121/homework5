##NBA QUIZ
For this NBA quiz, the objective of the game is to click on the correct answer to obtain win points. The game operates by sorting through an array of objects. The questions and answer options are displayed by being appended into the empty rows pre made in an HTML skeleton. Once any single answer option is clicked, the entire HTML skeleton of question and 4 answer options rows disappears and are cleared, then re-appended with the next iteration of questions and answers within the array of objects. A global variable counter keeps track of how many total instances of finishing a question iteration, wether the player answers correct, incorrect, or does not answer within 15 seconds. Once the global variable counter is equal to the total length of the questions bank (both start at 0 and incriment 1 with each new question generated), the final screen function executed which will show a "thank you for playing" screen, a lebron gif, and 3 seconds later a button to restart so that the player can maintain their running total score. While tough to read at times, I love my background so much that I instead changed all the Font weights to very high values, instead of changing background opacity or image altogether. The gif at the end is removed by a setTimeout made based on the duration of the gif.
